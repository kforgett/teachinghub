Observations and Course Reviews
===============================
The DWR requires all teachers to be observed and all online courses to be reviewed on a regular basis. Please use this interface to record and submit observations and course reviews for face-to-face and online DWR classes. For help with this system, please contact `Andrew Davis. <mailto:addavis@olemiss.edu>`_

Course Observations (Spring 2022)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DWR policy requires all faculty to be observed at least once per three-semester cycle (see the Observation Policy). Due to COVID-19 restrictions, the current cycle has been expanded to include the Spring 2020, Fall 2020, Spring 2021, Fall 2021, and Spring 2022 semesters. As the University continues to monitor and respond to pandemic conditions, changes in this schedule may occur. Changes will be announced via the listserv.
